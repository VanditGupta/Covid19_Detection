# Covid-19 and Pneumonia Recognition using X-Ray, Streamlit, CNN and TensorFlow ðŸ¦ 

## Description

Covid-19 and Pneumonia Recognition is an advanced medical imaging application designed to assist in the diagnosis of Covid-19 and pneumonia using X-ray images. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and TensorFlow, it offers an intuitive platform for healthcare professionals to analyze X-ray images with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

The CNN Model, was trained with over 300 X-Ray Images, 100 Images for each class, Covid, Pneumonia and Normal X-Ray.

## Features

- **Automated Diagnosis**: Quick and automated classification of X-ray images into Covid-19, Pneumonia, or Normal.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Utilizes sophisticated image processing techniques for accurate analysis.
- **Robust Machine Learning Model**: Powered by a TensorFlow-based CNN model trained on a diverse dataset.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Rapid processing and presentation of diagnostic results.
- **Secure and Reliable**: Implements rigorous data validation and error handling for secure usage.
